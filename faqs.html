                    If you have brought up in India, probabilities are that you recognize the ideas of caste and religion all too well and how it moves our lives. Our society is separated into high and low caste people and on the basis of this they are treated differently. When you go to a different nation, you understand that these society-forced differences do not have any significance and people should be identified for their real talents. In a foreign land, your need for company increases and you understand that being biased towards people of a specific nationality will not help you anywhere.
